# Build Dependencies
### nasm
To build Skylight, you need nasm v2.15 or earlier. Otherwise, the assembler may spit out obsolete or archaic warnings. Whatever it is, it is unknown, so stick with v2.15.
### clang
Skylight builds with clang12, however Skylight also compiles with `-pedantic` so there is a bit of backwards compatibility. Would not recommend using gcc4/clang5 or earlier.
### mtools
Just install mtools, no compatibility issues have been detected at this moment.
### wget
You should already have this. If not, install it.
